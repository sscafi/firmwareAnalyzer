## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sscafi/firmware-analyzer.git
   cd firmware-analyzer

## Usage

To run the firmware analysis, create an instance of the `firmwareAnalyzer` class and call the `run_analysis()` method:

*python
*from firmware_analyzer import firmwareAnalyzer

*analyzer = firmwareAnalyzer()
*analyzer.run_analysis()

## Method Descriptions

### `run_analysis(self)`

This method orchestrates the entire firmware analysis process. It calls several methods in sequence to perform a comprehensive analysis:

1. **`extract_firmware()`**: Extracts files from the firmware image.
2. **`analyze_strings()`**: Analyzes strings within the firmware for potential vulnerabilities.
3. **`check_file_types()`**: Validates the types of files found in the firmware.
4. **`analyze_elf_files()`**: Examines ELF files for security concerns.
5. **`scan_for_vulnerabilities()`**: Scans the firmware against known vulnerability databases.
6. **`yara_scan()`**: Scans files using YARA rules to identify malware.
7. **`check_certificates()`**: Validates embedded certificates for authenticity.
8. **`analyze_configs()`**: Reviews configuration files for security misconfigurations.
9. **`check_for_backdoors()`**: Searches for potential backdoors in the firmware.
10. **`calculate_hashes()`**: Computes hashes for file integrity checks.
11. **`check_nvd_vulnerabilities()`**: Checks against the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
12. **`perform_control_flow_analysis()`**: Analyzes the control flow of binaries for vulnerabilities.
13. **`emulate_firmware()`**: Emulates the firmware to observe its behavior.
14. **`analyze_network_traffic()`**: Analyzes network traffic generated by the firmware.
15. **`detect_anomalies()`**: Detects anomalies in the firmware behavior or traffic patterns.
16. **`generate_pdf_report()`**: Generates a PDF report summarizing the analysis results.
17. **`analyze_file()`**: Performs a detailed analysis on specific files.


### Notes for Customization
1. **Repository URL**: Update the `git clone` URL to point to your actual GitHub repository.
2. **Module Name**: Ensure that the module name in the usage section reflects the actual name of your Python file or module where the `firmwareAnalyzer` class is defined.
3. **Additional Details**: Feel free to add any additional sections or details relevant to your project, such as examples of method usage, requirements for specific analyses, or any other information that could help users understand and utilize your tool effectively.
